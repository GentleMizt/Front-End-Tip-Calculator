## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Variables
- Vanilla JavaScript


### What I learned

I learnt how to make use of CSS Variables for better stylings.
More Flexibility with Javascript Arrays and Array Methods, learnt and made use of the parsefloat() method in JavaScript.



### Continued development

Moving forward, i'd be taking on more projects to get familiar with the JavaScript language, knowing how to deduce the logic of a project, e.t.c.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS6Y0ezhyCs&feature=youtu.be) - This helped me for with the array methods and the eval function used in this project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
