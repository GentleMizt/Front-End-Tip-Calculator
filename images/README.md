## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Variables
- Vanilla JavaScript


### What I learned

I learnt how to make use of CSS Variables for better stylings.
More Flexibility with Javascript Arrays and Array Methods, learnt and made use of the parsefloat() method in JavaScript.



### Continued development

Moving forward, i'd be taking on more projects to get familiar with the JavaScript language, knowing how to deduce the logic of a project, e.t.c.
